# DEPENDENCY INJECTION updated 2022/03/20
[This project is a stub](https://github.com/gra-m/mbf-di)
This was a locally created version following on with the course. Eventually I forked the course repo and completed
the code alongs on branches there.

I deleted all of the helpful branches that were left in the forked repository, doh! But I am coding them again anyway.

This course is going into more detail than the course I followed in 2021, and even though a lot of it is going over
old ground it is definitely worth it he obviously has tons of Spring experience.
So the main work is now happening here on the [forked repo sfg-di](https://github.com/gra-m/sfg-di):
